# Fireworks Show

[Fireworks Show](https://chrisbrickey.github.io/custom-fireworks3/index3.html) is an activity set against a night sky that allows users to design their own fireworks show by choosing the location, color and relative timing of fireworks.  The explosion trajectories of the fireworks are generated by custom trigonometric algorithms.

## Features Highlight

#### Custom Algorithm Trajectories
A graceful modal overlays each users profile page when one of their images is selected.  It shows details of the post and allows the creator of a post to edit the details with instant update across the application.

#### Firework Placement
The Like button toggles to indicate whether the current user has or has not liked a particular post and the sum total likes for each post updates live.  Comments can be added on-the-spot by simply typing and returning. They are instantly viewable by all users.  Post and delete buttons are also made available to the user for further guidance and ease-of-use.  Likes and comments are protected such that only the user initiating either a like or comment can reverse/delete it.

#### Demo Show
Users can upload with ease with drag/drop functionality.  They can also double-click in the same spot if they prefer to select a file from their directories.

#### Intuitive Instructions
Original development plans included a tutorial, but
Users are greeted with an intuitive login page that guides them to successful login with informative and friendly error messages.

## Technology

Fireworks Show is a single-page web application that mimics physics with low reliance on external libraries:

- Vanilla JavaScript to manage structure, handle game logic, and manually create intricate animation shapes with custom trigonometric algorithms
- `Canvas` to display animations
- `Webpack` to bundle and serve up various scripts

## Future Development

#### Multiple Firework Shapes & Sounds
Users will customize fireworks by combining color, shape, and sound each time they add a firework.

#### Custom Firework Design
Enable users to determine custom shapes of fireworks by adjusting some of the inputs to the algorithms that determine firework shape.

#### Speed Control & Playback
Users will control the speed of play and rewind and fastforward through their show.
