# Fireworks Show

[Fireworks Show](https://chrisbrickey.github.io/custom-fireworks3/index3.html) is an activity set against a night sky that allows users to design their own fireworks show by choosing the location, color, and relative timing of fireworks.  The explosion trajectories of the fireworks are generated by custom trigonometric algorithms.

## Features Highlight

#### Demo Show
Users can play a pre-designed show with a single click.

#### Custom Algorithm Trajectories
I used trigonometry to direct the trajectories of each pellet over hundreds of iterations to create custom animations with vanilla JavaScript.

```
let fade = 0;
let magnitude = 100;
let gravity = -20;
let counter = 0;
let numIterations = 300;


let z = setInterval(function(){

    fireContext.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)";
    fireContext.clearRect(0, 0, fireCanvas.width, fireCanvas.height);

    for(let i = 0; i < x.pelletArray.length; i++) {

        let pelote = x.pelletArray[i];
        let newAlpha = pelote.alpha - fade;

        let newX = pelote.x;
        let newY = pelote.y;
        let changeX = 0;
        let changeY = 0;

        let p = Math.random();
        let theta = (2 * Math.PI * p);
        changeX = magnitude * Math.cos(theta) * Math.random();
        changeY = magnitude * Math.sin(theta) * Math.random();

```
...
```
    magnitude += 5;
    gravity += 3;
    counter++;
    if (fade < 1){
      fade += (0.02);
    }

    if(counter === numIterations) {
        clearInterval(z);
    }
}, 20);

}
```

#### Intuitive Instructions
Development plans included a tutorial, but I made the game more intuitive by condensing instruction into the labels for the buttons. This enables users to start the activity with minimal reading.

#### Firework Placement
Users can see the location and color of each firework placed (before the show plays) to aid in design.

## Technology

Fireworks Show is a single-page web application that mimics physics with low reliance on external libraries:

- Vanilla JavaScript to manage structure, handle game logic, and manually create intricate animation shapes with custom algorithms
- `Canvas` to display animations
- `Webpack` to bundle and serve up various scripts

## Future Development

#### Multiple Firework Shapes & Sounds
Users will customize fireworks by combining color, shape, and sound each time they add a firework.

#### Custom Algorithm Design
Users will determine custom shapes of fireworks by adjusting some of the inputs to the algorithms that determine firework trajectory and shape.

#### Speed Control & Playback
Users will control the speed of play and be able to rewind and fast-forward through their show.
